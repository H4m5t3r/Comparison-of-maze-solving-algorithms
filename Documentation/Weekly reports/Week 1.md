# Week 1
This week I attended the introduction lecture and decided what kind of algorithms I am going to analyze during this course. I read through the course material as well as the Wikipedia page called "Maze solving algorithm" and familiarized myself with different kinds of maze solving algorithms. I decided to go for the recursive and dead-end filling algorithm since they both make use of seeing the whole maze at once. I also created a GitHub repository for the project. What I did not know before was that you can make NetBeans update the .gitignore file automatically. This will probably be very useful in the future.

I was hesitative when I chose what algorithms to analyze. I am still a bit unsure of whether dead-end filling and the recursive maze solving algorithm are good algorithms to compare but it seems like it could work.

The next steps will probably be to find out how to generate random mazes and to start implement the maze solving algorithms. I already started reading the Daedalus maze program page but did not read that much theory since I was still unsure of the topic of my project.

Amount of hours spent this week: 12

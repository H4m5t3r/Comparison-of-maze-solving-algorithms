# Implementation document

The different algorithms used in this program are all implemented in their own Java classes. These are controlled by the class called "Logic". The graphical user interface uses a Logic class to call different methods from the classes when the user clicks different buttons.

The some of the algorithms use data structures like stacks and linked lists. These have been implemented in the package called "maze.data_structures".
